        shot to fame after leading India to glory in the Under-19 World Cup at
        Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like
        icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most
        un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast. Grind
        through the ranks He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka,
        come August 2008. In the absence of the regular openers, Virat Kohli was
        given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some
        commendable knocks in his extended run as an opener, as India went on to
        win the ODI series. However, the established and formidable pair of
        Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team.

      <h2>AB Devillers</h2>

      <p>
        Some cricketers' rise to the top constitutes hours of perseverance and
        hardwork, and others' include, predominantly, an abundance of talent and
        natural ability. Abraham Benjamin de Villiers is that player you create
        in a computer game, who has both the attributes set to maximum, and then
        some.de Villiers has risen through the ranks to become one of the
        world's finest batsmen, most versatile batsmen, across all formats. When
        on song, de Villiers has the ability to take any bowling attack apart
        with his wide array of strokes on either side of the wicket. If his
        orthodoxy is compact and aesthetically pleasing, the South African
        avant-garde's trailblazing innovation often rendered bowlers
        speechless.His supreme ability caught the eye of the selectors as he was
        fast-tracked into the national squad as a raw 20-year-old in 2004. He
        made his Test debut in the home series against England in 2004 and
        exhibited his class with a sublime 52 in just his fourth innings with
        the bat, saving South Africa from what looked like a certain defeat. He
        also registered his first Test century in the series - a fluent 109 on
        his home ground in Centurion. In short, he'd wasted no time and had
        shown the world his capability immediately.

      <h2>Brendon Mccullum</h2>
      <img class="playerspic" src="./images/baz.webp" />
      <p>
        'Brash' - that is the word Brendon McCullum, easily the greatest of all
        the Kiwi glovesmen, and one of their finest batsmen, uses to define
        himself.Adam Gilchrist and MS Dhoni might be the first names that come
        to mind when we discuss pyrotechnics-prone wicketkeepers, but this Kiwi
        hunk would definitely be a prime contender. Younger son of a First-Class
        player of Otago, this explosive stumper from Dunedin, New Zealand, was
        first selected for his country, not surprisingly, more on the back of
        his batting rather than his wicket-keeping skills. Predominantly
        favouring the leg-side, especially the cow corner, McCullum has made a
        name for himself by piling on quick runs as an opener in the 50 and
        20-over format of the game.In the longer version of the game, his first
        few centuries came against lesser opponents like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh
        and, except for a 96 against England at Lord's, he didn't have any
        strong performances against the heavyweights to justify his place in the
        side. But all that changed in the fifth year of his career, when he
        racked up his third Test hundred against India in quick time at Napier
        in 2009. McCullum, followed it up by amassing a double ton laced with a
        blend of composure and savagery against India in Hyderabad. In 2010,
        McCullum, decided to relinquish the keeping mitts to focus on his
        batting.

      <h2>Aliaster Cook</h2>

      <p>
        '15,000 Test runs and 50 Test centuries are not beyond him' - Sunil
        Gavaskar said about Alastair Cook.It is not easy for a batsman to
        receive such high praise from a former cricketer, especially when the
        concerned persons are from different countries. The fact that those
        words came from a batsman who is considered one of the best openers Test
        cricket has ever seen makes it even praiseworthy. Such is Cook’s
        reputation in World Cricket at the moment that, at the age of 28, he is
        already considered as a legend, or at least one in the making.It is
        never easy being a Test opener in the country of England – the new ball
        generally swings rapidly and it takes a great deal of quality for any
        opener to survive, let alone score runs consistently. But Cook is
        blessed with a robust technique, temperament and the patience required
        to counter the conditions even when they are not conducive to batting,
        especially at the top order.

      <h2>Pattrick Cummins</h2>

      <p>
        A fiery Pat Cummins set the international arena ablaze with his Test
        debut in 2011 on a juicy Wanderers pitch. A seven-wicket match haul
        including a six-fer in the second innings gave Australia a chaseable
        score which they eventually gunned down, albeit by a narrow margin.
        Amidst the victory celebrations, the talk was all about this exciting
        fast bowler who had all the weapons a pacer needed. He was impeccably
        complete, that too at such an early age which promised so much. Tragedy
        struck though, which meant that he didn't play a single Test match for
        about six years.Cummins' has no real weakness in his skill set but a
        fragile body meant that he couldn't capitalize on the sensational debut
        that he had. Although he did feature in white-ball cricket during this
        Test hiatus, there too he wasn't a regular starter with injuries
        inevitably consuming him at frequent intervals. It did seem like such a
        powerhouse of talent would end up combusting in the flame of injuries.
        However, the 2016-17 season saw Cummins upping his fitness levels in a
        big way. After a few years of constant preparation, it seemed like the
        body was finally starting to be stable.
